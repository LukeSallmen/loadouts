    <p>Data</p>

    <p>There are two main sources of data that will be important to my app: gear info scraped from sites from the web 
        (I'll scrape with node per the rec of piazza responses by Professor Duvall.), 
        and then also lists of these pieces of gear that users will make out of different combinations of this scraped data.
        So far I have only made progress with what the scraped data will look like, which should be something like:
        items: [
        { bag: 'No Escape', brand: 'Mystery Ranch', capacity: 25 },
        { bag: 'Two Day Assault Pack', brand: 'Mystery Ranch', capacity: 27 },
        { bag: 'Prizefighter', brand: 'Mystery Ranch', capacity: 21 },
        { bag: "Urban Assault 24", brand: 'Mystery Ranch', capacity: 24 },
        { bag: 'GR1', brand: 'GORUCK', capacity: 26 },
        { bag: 'GR3', brand: 'GORUCK', capacity: 45 },
        { bag: 'Main Campus', brand: 'Jansport', capacity: 34 },

        The user data will be lists of items from the bags, clothing, wallets, and pouches lists, as well as their user IDs, maybe whether the lists are shareable, etc.
      ]
</p>

<p>Progress:</p>

    <p>So far I have implemented the general structure for the lists of gear that I'll scrape and then display to the users to choose from. 
        As you can see, I have added simple search and sorting via bootstrap-vue. 
        I have yet to add the ability for users to actually add these items to their lists,
        and I still have to do the frontend for a user to see which items they have added to their list. 
        I still have to implement the backend, including routing, auth and database connects. I anticipate those will take the longest.</p>

    <p>Concerns:</p>

    <p>I am a bit worried about connecting the server work because I've struggled with it throughout the course.</p>

    <p>Learning:</p>

    <p>I've learned that the architecture / data flow part of planning an app is super super important and actually pretty challenging, 
        but I like that we have built up to it by learning how to pass information throughout the course so far.
    I also quite like bootstrap-vue, especially the tables and just the plethora of features for things like navigation</p>

    <p>Plan:</p>

    <p>For the next deadline I plan to have the frontend completely finished, a basic version of my scraping finished, and to have begun to set up routes / users / the database in a basic way.</p>
    
    <p>Summary:</p>

    <p>I feel I've made good progress but my project isn't small in scope and I need to be diligent in implementing the backend because that's where I always struggle the most.</p>
