    <p>Data</p>

    <p>There are two main sources of data that will be important to my app: gear info scraped from sites from the web 
        (I'll scrape with node per the rec of piazza responses by Professor Duvall.), 
        and then also lists of these pieces of gear that users will make out of different combinations of this scraped data.
        So far I have only made progress with what the scraped data will look like, which should be something like:
        items: [
        { bag: 'No Escape', brand: 'Mystery Ranch', capacity: 25 },
        { bag: 'Two Day Assault Pack', brand: 'Mystery Ranch', capacity: 27 },
        { bag: 'Prizefighter', brand: 'Mystery Ranch', capacity: 21 },
        { bag: "Urban Assault 24", brand: 'Mystery Ranch', capacity: 24 },
        { bag: 'GR1', brand: 'GORUCK', capacity: 26 },
        { bag: 'GR3', brand: 'GORUCK', capacity: 45 },
        { bag: 'Main Campus', brand: 'Jansport', capacity: 34 },

        The user data will be lists of items from the bags, clothing, wallets, and pouches lists, as well as their user IDs, maybe whether the lists are shareable, etc.
      ]
</p>

<p>Progress:</p>

    <p>I have implemented the general structure for the lists of gear that I'll scrape and then display to the users to choose from. 
        I have added pages that display the different types of gear users can choose from
        As you can see, I have added simple search and sorting via bootstrap-vue. 
        I have added a contact page and an about page.
        I've added several components, like the footer, the info for my about page, and more.
        I have to add the ability for users to add items to their lists and to make new lists, 
        This should just be fairly easy on the frontend, just pushing to an array and then dynamically displaying
        Based on that array.
    </p>

    <p>Concerns:</p>

    <p>I am a litte behind schedule as I have not completely finished the frontend, and therefore haven't gotten to other parts of my project.</p>

    <p>Learning:</p>

    <p>I've learned that documentation-reading is almost always the best way to get the help that I need! Especially bootstrap-vue docs, as they are really good</p>

    <p>Plan:</p>

    <p>For the next deadline I plan to complete the rest of the frontend (actually this time), have a basic version of my scraping finished, and to have begun to set up routes / users / the database in a basic way.</p>
    
    <p>Summary:</p>

    <p>I feel I've made good progress but am mostly stuck on data flow things which should be helped when I have implemented the backend. 
        I still need to be diligent in working, especially on implementing the backend because that's where I always struggle the most.</p>
