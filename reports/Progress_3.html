    <p>Data</p>

    <p>There are two main sources of data that will be important to my app: gear info scraped from sites from the web 
        (I'll scrape with node per the rec of piazza responses by Professor Duvall.), 
        and then also lists of these pieces of gear that users will make out of different combinations of this scraped data.
        So far I have only made progress with what the scraped data will look like, which should be something like:
        items: [
        { bag: 'No Escape', brand: 'Mystery Ranch', capacity: 25 },
        { bag: 'Two Day Assault Pack', brand: 'Mystery Ranch', capacity: 27 },
        { bag: 'Prizefighter', brand: 'Mystery Ranch', capacity: 21 },
        { bag: "Urban Assault 24", brand: 'Mystery Ranch', capacity: 24 },
        { bag: 'GR1', brand: 'GORUCK', capacity: 26 },
        { bag: 'GR3', brand: 'GORUCK', capacity: 45 },
        { bag: 'Main Campus', brand: 'Jansport', capacity: 34 },

        The user data will be lists of items from the bags, clothing, wallets, and pouches lists, as well as their user IDs, maybe whether the lists are shareable, etc.
      ]
</p>

<p>Progress:</p>

    <p>I have implemented 99% of the fronted. Eventually I will clean it up, but for now basically everything I want to do is complete,
    including user lists, a basic profile page, a home page, and an updated about us page. I've fixed all of the links from last time and restructured my frontend to be easier for me to maintain.
    Next up I have to add the server and user auth as well as testing. 
    </p>

    <p>Concerns:</p>

    <p>I am still a litte behind schedule, but my data should be quite easy to work with. I need to add backend auth and testing in less than a week.</p>

    <p>Learning:</p>

    <p>I've learned that sometimes the fastest way to fix something is to completely rewrite it from scratch :(</p>

    <p>Plan:</p>

    <p>For the next deadline I plan to work on the server side and auth, as well as testing.</p>
    
    <p>Summary:</p>

    <p>I feel I've made excellent progress and un-stuck myself!
        I still need to be diligent in working, especially on implementing the backend.</p>
