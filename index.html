    <p>Plan</p>

    <p>Idea</p>

    <p>Loadouts is service similar to <a href=”https://pcpartpicker.com/list/”> PcPartPicker </a>, but for daily
    carry items and/or maybe clothing.
    If none of those words meant anything to you, the idea is to create a service where users can create and share lists
    of things that they use or carry with them on a daily basis.
    Users will be able to select the backpack they use (or want to use!) from, say, Patagonia, North Face, and Herschel
    packs (from a set of pre-defined backpack makers and particular models of packs) and add it to their list of carried
    items.

    They can do the same with their water bottle, wallet, purse, mask, socks, etc. They can get inspiration for buying
    longer-lasting and sustainable, as well as just cool products from seeing other users’ lists, and they can add items
    they want to buy to their wish lists to buy later. There are two main motivations for a site like this: some people,
    such as me, are super into “gear” in the general sense, and would appreciate a service that allows them to organize
    and share what they own in a digital format. Secondarily, I hope to add metrics for durability, sustainability, and
    other metrics for evaluating how good companies (and products) are, and I aim to encourage people to buy lesser
    quantities of better-made items, in an attempt to fight against needless consumerism and fast-fashion.
</p>

<p>Scope:</p>

    <p>I was able to implement a server acting as an API to send the gear data to the frontend and to deploy both frontend and backend as live URLs. 
        I was also able to implement a list that users can add to, although I didn't figure out persistence too well. 

    <p>Data Sources:</p>

    <p>I was not able to implement a scraping function unfortunately due to time constraints but hope to add a massive spreadsheet of bags that I found on Reddit later. All of my data is written by me</p>

    <p>Data Structure:</p>

    <p>The basic data structure will have a table of users who have emails, IDs, and lists. The lists table will have IDs
    and items, which will have IDs, names, companies, prices, URLs, links to images, and so on. The companies table will
    have IDs and items that they sell.</p>
